## Our Goal:
Our goal is to make an interactive game geared towards high school students in order to help them learn more about quantum computing and its applications.

## Our Game:
Our game, called <i>Quantum Checkers</i>, is a game where you manipulate qubits (quantum bits) in order to mimic a pattern created by the specific use of certain quantum gates on the aforementioned qubits.

## Our Team:
Our team consists of three sub-teams: Supervisors, Backend Developers, and Frontend Developers.
#### Our Supervisor: Dr. Ren
#### Our Backend Developer: Amin Boukari
#### Our Frontend Developers: Noah Klaus, London Anderson
